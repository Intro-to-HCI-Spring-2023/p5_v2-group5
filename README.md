Other releavant details about your repository below:
Tabluate is a cost-splitting app that aims to be a one-stop platform to split costs between friends. Our innovative receipt scanning functionality allows for easy itemization and automatic calculations for each item depending on how may people are splitting an item, tax, tip, and other calculation settings. Furthermore, we allow users to import contacts from different payment platforms (e.g. Venmo, Zelle, Paypal) to allow for requests to be sent directly from our app - eliminating the need for using multiple apps to request for payment.
